# Scenario C: Daniel’s Return to MTG

## Scene 1: Stepping Back In
- **Description**: Daniel enters a local game store after years away. He notices newer sets and hears people discussing “London Mulligan.”
- **Image Prompt**:
  > Daniel, in his late 30s, carrying older Magic cards, looking around a modern game store with bright new sets displayed, realistic style.

## Scene 2: Mulligan Tool Introduction
- **Description**: A friend suggests the Mulligan Tool. Daniel tries it, generating sample 7- and 6-card hands from his deck.
- **Image Prompt**:
  > A web app on a tablet showing two side-by-side sample hands (7 vs. 6), with a "better/worse" comparison.

## Scene 3: “Tinder Comparison”
- **Description**: The tool’s interface uses a simple swipe-like gesture (left to reject, right to keep) to help Daniel decide if a borderline 7 is worse than a typical 6.
- **Image Prompt**:
  > Daniel swiping left on an underwhelming 7-card hand in a visually friendly UI, realistic style.

## Scene 4: Renewed Confidence
- **Description**: Daniel feels more at ease with modern mechanics and decides to attend the next local event with his updated deck.
- **Image Prompt**:
  > Daniel smiling as he organizes his deck, an aura of renewed enthusiasm, realistic style.
